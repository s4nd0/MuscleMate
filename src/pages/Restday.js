      <h3 className="planWindow-header">What is Rest Day?</h3>
      <p className="planWindow-content">
        Rest day in a gym workout routine plays a crucial role in the
        regeneration and development of muscles. Proper rest helps prevent
        overtraining, reduces the risk of injuries, and allows the body to fully
        recover.
      </p>
      <h3 className="planWindow-header">what should it look like?</h3>
      <p className="planWindow-content">
        A proper rest day at the gym should involve complete physical and mental
        relaxation, allowing your muscles to recover and repair. Adequate sleep
        and proper hydration are essential components of an effective rest day
        to support overall recovery and optimize performance in subsequent
        training sessions.
      </p>
      <h3 className="planWindow-header">Gentle Stretching:</h3>
      <p className="planWindow-content">
        Start the day with a short session of gentle stretching. This can
        improve muscle flexibility and increase the range of motion. Stretching
        exercises can also contribute to easing muscle tension.
      </p>
      <h3 className="planWindow-header">Light Walk or Outdoor Activity:</h3>
      <p className="planWindow-content">
        During the day, engage in a light walk or other outdoor activity. This
        not only promotes blood circulation but also provides a refreshing break
        from the usual gym environment. Nature walks or low-impact activities
        help maintain overall fitness without putting additional strain on
        recovering muscles.
      </p>
      <h3 className="planWindow-header">Hydration and Nutrient-Rich Meals:</h3>
      <p className="planWindow-content">
        Focus on staying well-hydrated and consuming nutrient-rich meals.
        Adequate hydration is essential for muscle recovery, and a balanced diet
        provides the necessary nutrients for overall health and muscle repair.
      </p>
      <h3 className="planWindow-header">Active Recovery Techniques:</h3>
      <p className="planWindow-content">
        Consider incorporating active recovery techniques such as foam rolling
        or gentle yoga. These activities can enhance flexibility, alleviate
        muscle soreness, and contribute to a faster recovery process.
      </p>
      <h3 className="planWindow-header">Rest and Sleep:</h3>
      <p className="planWindow-content">
        Allow yourself ample time for rest and quality sleep. Sleep is a
        critical component of the recovery process, as it promotes the release
        of growth hormone and supports overall physical and mental well-being.
      </p>
      <h3 className="planWindow-header">
        Mindfulness or Relaxation Practices:
      </h3>
      <p className="planWindow-content">
        Incorporate mindfulness or relaxati on practices into your day, such as
        meditation or deep breathing exercises. These activities can help manage
        stress levels and contribute to a more balanced and rejuvenating rest
        day.
      </p>
      <h3 className="planWindow-header">Remember!</h3>
      <p className="planWindow-content">
        Well-planned rest day is an integral part of a successful workout
        routine, contributing to long-term fitness gains and overall well-being.
